        <p>The Cal Poly Engineering site is based on the Mezzanine Content Management System, which is in turn based on the Django web framework.  
          Django is a popular Python-based framework that powers such high-traffic sites such as Disqus.
        </p>

        <p>Several customizations were done to the site, including:</p>

        <ul class="site-highlights">
          <li><em>A "Features" app</em> -  This app allows content editors to publish rotating front page features.</li>
          <li><em>Tour administration</em> - Visitors to the college may sign up for a tour and get email reminders.  Tour guides are assigned an get automated reminders of their upcoming tours.</li>
          <li><em>Event Calendar</em> - The college can maintain a calendar of events easily.</li>
          <li><em>News Releases w/RSS</em> - News releases are published both as normal pages and as RSS feeds, which department sites republish.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The site is responsive and works well on mobile devices.</p>
