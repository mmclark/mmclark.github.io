        EPIC- Engineering Possibilities in College - is a one-week summer camp at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo that introduces campers to the varied fields of engineering through hands-on labs taught by university professors and industry professionals.  EPIC campers see "Learn by Doing" in action when Cal Poly students show them the satellites, prosthetic hands, race cars, concrete canoes and other products they've developed.  In addition, EPIC campers get to design, build and test their own projects!

        <p>The EPIC summer camp site is based on the Mezzanine Content Management System, which is in turn based on the Django web framework.  
          Django is a popular Python-based framework that powers such high-traffic sites such as Disqus.
        </p>

        <p>Several customizations were done to the site, including:</p>

        <ul class="site-highlights">
          <li><em>Custom User Profiles</em> -  Users on the system are categorized as Parent, Teacher or Mailing-list only</li>
          <li><em>Application Workflow</em> -  The site leads campers through a series of steps to fill out an application for the camp.</li>
          <li><em>Registration Workflow</em> -  Once a camper has been accepted, the camper fills out an additional set of forms to complete registration.</li>
          <li><em>Surveys</em> -  Pre and post camp surveys are administered to learn what campers took away from their camp experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The site is responsive and works well on mobile devices.</p>
